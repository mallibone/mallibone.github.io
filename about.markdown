Hey there my name is Mark. I'm a Microsoft MVP living in Switzerland and love to working on mobile and IoT apps. During my day job I work at Rey Automation. Where I get to develop & architect IoT apps or consult clients on their endavours. You can also find me on Bluesky [@mallibone](https://bsky.app/profile/mallibone.com).

Views and opinions are my own.
