Maybe it is old age or just a lack of attention, but I have felt a lot less flexible over the past, so I did what every app developer would do. Go to the app store and search for an app that could help. Not only did I find an app that has dramatically improved my flexibility due to a stretching routine focused on my weak points, but it also had a neat countdown button control. And since it is [UI July](https://goforgoldman.com/2022/05/19/maui-ui-july.html), this is a post for the said community event. Let's have a look at how we can create such a control.

Perhaps you might be wondering: What is this countdown button control you are talking about? - Well, thank you for asking. The control starts at 100%. While the seconds are counting down, the circle around the control reduces itself as time passes.

As you might have already thought. This is the time you are doing a stretch. So how can we implement such a control in .NET MAUI.

## The round button

Let's start with the easy bits, a round button control:

```xml
<Button x:Name="ProgressButton" 
        Text=""
        FontSize="18"
        FontFamily="fa-regular"
        HeightRequest="80"
        WidthRequest="80"
        CornerRadius="40"
        HorizontalOptions="Center"
        Clicked="StartButton_OnClicked"
        BackgroundColor="{StaticResource Secondary}"/>
```

A general rule of thumb a button is a rectangular UI element. We get a square if we set the `HeightRequest` and the `WidthRequest` to the same value. Further configuring the `CornerRadius` to half of the height/width value, we get a nice circle.

![A round button showing two remaining seconds.]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/2022-07-26-RoundButton.png "A round button showing two remaining seconds.")

We can set the default text to the play icon. For this, I added the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) font to the project. And if you have done this in the past with Xamarin, trust me, it is much quicker now, and a friendly [docs page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/fonts/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003494) will lead you through the steps. 

Back to the button. The countdown starts when we tap the button, and the button text shows the remaining seconds:

```c#
private void StartButton_OnClicked(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
    _startTime = DateTime.Now;
    _cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    UpdateArc();
}

private async void UpdateArc()
{
    while (!_cancellationTokenSource.IsCancellationRequested)
    {    
        var elapsedTime = (DateTime.Now - _startTime);
        int secondsRemaining = (int) (_duration - elapsedTime.TotalMilliseconds)/1000;

        ProgressButton.Text = $"{secondsRemaining}";

        // More stuff to come ...
      
	      await Task.Delay(500);
    }
    
    // Reset the view
}
```



## The reducing circle

To draw shapes, the [.NET MAUI Graphics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/controls/graphicsview?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003494) is always an exciting space to have a skim. And we are lucky there is the functionality present to draw a partial [ellipse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/graphics/draw#draw-an-ellipse?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003494), i.e. a circle if we set the `HeightRequest` and the `WidthRequest` with the same value. As the docs state, we can define the end angle, and the direction the drawing should happen, aka clock- or counter-clockwise.

To get a static sample of this progress ring, we add a new class that implements `IDrawable`.

```c#
public class ProgressArc : IDrawable
{
    public double Progress { get; set; }
    public void Draw(ICanvas canvas, RectF dirtyRect)
    {
        var endAngle = 180; // static angle for the show
        // Drawing code goes here
        canvas.StrokeColor = Color.FromRgba("6599ff");
        canvas.StrokeSize = 10;
        
        canvas.DrawArc(5, 5, (dirtyRect.Width - 10), (dirtyRect.Height - 10), 90, endAngle, false, false);
    }
}
```

The default starting point of the arc is at 3 o'clock on a watch face. We, therefore, set 90 degrees as an offset so it will be at noon on the watch face. With this, we have the basic layout of the circle, which can reduce itself. Now we have to hook it up to our UI to see it. 

 Presenting an`IDrawables` is done by adding it to a `GraphicsView`. Let's add a `GraphicsView` to our XAML file:

```xml
<GraphicsView x:Name="ProgressView"
							BackgroundColor="{StaticResource Primary}"
							HeightRequest="100"
							WidthRequest="100"/>
```

And since we made it a named element, we can then assign our `ProgressArc` in the `OnAppearing` method, which is invoked before the system draws the UI:

```c#
public partial class MainPage
{
    private ArcProgress _arcProgress = new ArcProgress();

    // Other members and the constructor

    protected override void OnAppearing()
    {
        // ...
        ProgressView.Drawable = new ArcProgress();
    }
}
```

This gives us the basics for presenting a static view of the arc. Now we will have to calculate the end angle. It is time for some maths. ðŸ¤“ 

Given we know the total duration of the countdown, we can calculate the degrees of progress:

```mathematica
circleDegree = elapsedTime / totalTime * 360
```

If we use this formula and embed it into our existing `Draw` function, the degrees of our `endAngle` are calculated as follows:

```c#
var endAngle = 90 - (int)Math.Round(Progress * 360, MidpointRounding.AwayFromZero);
```

Note the 90Â° offset that has to be included due to the offset we defined when drawing the arc. All left is to update the progress and invalidate the canvas in the existing `UpdateArc` function. 

```c#
private async void UpdateArc()
{
    while (!_cancellationTokenSource.IsCancellationRequested)
    {
        // existing code to update the button

        _progress = elapsedTime.TotalMilliseconds;
        _progress %= _duration;

        _progressArc.Progress = _progress / (float)_duration;
        ProgressView.Invalidate();
        
        await Task.Delay(500);
    }
    
    // Reset the view
}
```

Now to the final step, making the round button and the reducing circle align correctly on the UI.

### Putting it together

The alignment usually takes some tinkering. Since we want the circle to be just as big as the button or a tad smaller. In the end, I used this XAML:

```xml
<Grid>
    <GraphicsView ...
                  HeightRequest="100"
                  WidthRequest="100"/>
    <Button ...
            HeightRequest="80"
            WidthRequest="80"
            CornerRadius="40"
            ... />
</Grid>
```

> **Note:** By placing the button definition after the canvas, the button will be drawn higher on the Z-Axis. This approach has a few advantages. First and foremost, the circle can still be seen even if the background of the canvas is not transparent. But more important the button can still be tapped by the user since it is on top of the canvas.

And that was it. Here we have our beautiful countdown button control.

### Conclusion

And this concludes the countdown button timer. As you can see, drawing round buttons was pretty straightforward. Drawing the circle was a bit more involved, but it also showed that you could create a different shape using .NET MAUI Graphics. Be sure to check out the [docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/maui/user-interface/graphics/?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5003494) to see the full potential of this library because you will get these goodies all out of the box with .NET MAUI.

You can find a small sample application on [GitHub](https://github.com/mallibone/MauiUI2022ProgressButton). And don't forget to look out for existing and other [UI July posts](https://goforgoldman.com/2022/05/19/maui-ui-july.html) all around .NET MAUI eye candy.
