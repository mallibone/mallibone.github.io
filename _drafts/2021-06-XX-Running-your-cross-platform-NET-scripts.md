Since playing around more with F# scripts to ease my daily chores on the computer. I felt like my previous post LLLINK left out on the part of how you can execute those scripts. So let's focus less on the developing/tinkering but more on the execution of those F# scripts. Running scripts can be done by using the F# Interactive LLLINK tooling that is shipped with the .NET SDK LLLINK. We can execute a script as follows:

```bash
dotnet fsi the-name-of-your-script.fsx
```

Now this is when we are in the same directory as the script (or have added the directory to the [$PATH](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-add-directory-to-path-in-linux/) or [%PATH%](https://www.architectryan.com/2018/03/17/add-to-the-path-on-windows-10/)). I like to put my scripts into a location in my user directory. Something like `~/scripts/`. Which makes the command above even longer. And having to type all those keys for every little helper. Makes you want to write a script just to invoke that script. ðŸ˜†



## Putting scripts at your fingertips

Once a working script we can now save the file and invoke it from the command line. Only problem is, we kind of have to remember where the script is. One possible solution is putting it into a folder in our users root directory. Let's say we put all our scripts into the `scripts` folder we could then invoke your script like this:

```bash
dotnet fsi ~/scripts/cleanBuildDirs.fsx
```

And although this command looks rather bash-like it actually also works when using PowerShell. But it still feels quite long winded, what if you have some scripts you always want at the tip of your fingers. Perhaps the ones that get you through your day just that bit easier and quicker, well for those we want to go one step further.

So with your script at hand how about we simply had to type a few keys hit enter and have it run, where ever we are. While this is not a F# tip per say, it is always good to remember that the command line comes with a few powermoves of it's own. To be more precise we actually have two options. One is adding the script folder to the path variable. With this you can simply type `dotnet fsi cleanBuildDirs.fsx` from where ever you want. Configuring the path depends on your operating system: Windows, macOS and Linux.

But let's say you write a script that you want to execute multiple times a day. You probably want something even faster than that. And this is where setting up an alias comes into play. On macOS you can add the following line to the end of your `.bashrc` file LLLINK. The filename can differ depending on the bash/terminal program used on the system:

CCCODE

For PowerShell you can add the following line to your XXX file LLLINK:

CCCODE

You might have to restart your terminal/shell of choice for the changes to take effect. But then you can simply enter the alias and off your script will run.

Note: If the file does not exist, you can go forward and create it.



## Execution time

You see that we are stopping the execution time for this script by using `#time`. When we execute this script I get the following result on my console:

CCCODE

But that is only half of the truth. It takes some time to spin up FSI. The spin up time is not included in the previous stats. But there  we can use the command line to help us out here. For Mac/Linux we can use the `time` tool:

```bash
time dotnet fsi greetings.fsx
```

Side note: On Windows we can use the `Measure-Command {dotnet fsi greetings.fsx}`.

And now we get the actual execution time:

CCCODE

Now we could put on our science hat and put this in a loop and then do some averaging etc. But nothing changes the fact that it seems to take over one second to execute this simple script. And most of the time seems to be due to FSI spinning up.

> FSI is a great tool. While it does allow you to use it for running scripts it is geared towards supporting developers as a Read Eval Print Loop (REPL) tool. And as a REPL the startup costs only hit you once, think of it as your Integrated Development Environment (IDE) starting up - it takes some time. But once the IDE is up and running you get a great productivity boost. And same goes for FSI, it is optimised for a different use case.

On the interwebs one alternative that promises faster execution time is the Fake cli tool. LLLINK On repeating the execution I got roughly XXX. While this is clearly better it still isn't instant.

Doping your scripts

Some might say this is cheating. But this is an option if you are using F#/.NET. Migrate your script to a console application and enjoying the bliss of the .NET runtime performance. After migrating our script to a console app:

CCOOODE

We can compile and package our app:

dotnet publish asdf

> The example above will create a package for macOS. But you can compile your .NET app for Windows and Linux alike by changing the XXXX parameter to one out of the [catalog](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/rid-catalog).

If we now navigate to the output folder XXX (this may vary on the XXX you have set), we see a whole bunch of files. We can execute the app by invoking our command:

CCCODE

This is quite a bit faster than invoking our script with FSI. If we now copy and paste the entire content of our folder to our scripts folder. We use it just like a script file, but with much quicker execution times.

## Conclusion

Writing scripts is fun, but using them on a daily bases requires some thought and effort into how easy it will be to use the scripts when going forward. So be sure you have a place where you put your everyday helpers and make use of aliases for those scripts you run over and over.

Another aspect of scripting is execution time. For most scripts I write taking the FSI hit is not that big of a deal, since I am running only once in a while. But when startup time becomes crucial, moving your scripts to console apps might be a good option. Though everything comes at a cost. When moving to compiled helpers, making changes will involve a few more steps.

There are some tradeoffs when using this approach.

For one editing a script file is super straight forward. Once we have a compiled version we now have to edit the source, compile, copy & paste, enjoy the bliss. Compared



XXXX

For demonstration purpose I will reuse the script LLLINK I in my previous post that cleans up the `bin` and `obj` folders within a the subdirectories of a given path.



PATH



Alias



Slow startup times -> Use fake cli (compare startup times)
